1
00:00:02,378 --> 00:00:05,088
Today again, I say here’s to this wonderful world

2
00:00:05,088 --> 00:00:07,966
Laughter erupting all over the city

3
00:00:07,966 --> 00:00:11,719
Pretend not to look, it’s all fake

4
00:00:12,428 --> 00:00:14,263
About to lose my mind

5
00:00:14,304 --> 00:00:16,723
An alluring scent that makes me lightheaded

6
00:00:16,724 --> 00:00:18,642
Stimulates my nose

7
00:00:18,641 --> 00:00:20,935
Wakes me up instinctively

8
00:00:20,935 --> 00:00:23,979
Whose turn is it today?

9
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:27,817
What can be done in this world?

10
00:00:27,817 --> 00:00:30,611
What can I do?

11
00:00:30,611 --> 00:00:33,238
Just want to make sure that from those pitch-black eyes

12
00:00:33,237 --> 00:00:36,198
Tears won’t fall

13
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:39,701
For a better future, again and again

14
00:00:39,701 --> 00:00:40,827
I keep grasping

15
00:00:40,828 --> 00:00:44,832
In this world full of wrong

16
00:00:44,832 --> 00:00:47,751
I want you to smile

17
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:50,169
Don’t want to hurt anyone anymore

18
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:52,964
Want to be strong, strong

19
00:00:52,963 --> 00:00:56,633
So I can stay true to myself

20
00:01:04,807 --> 00:01:07,435
Today again, this wonderful world is safe

21
00:01:07,435 --> 00:01:10,604
Bad rumors swirling in the city

22
00:01:10,603 --> 00:01:14,732
Turned a blind, blind eye and looked away

23
00:01:14,733 --> 00:01:16,526
It’s pure madness

24
00:01:16,525 --> 00:01:19,152
People dressed up dead seriously for a march

25
00:01:19,153 --> 00:01:21,864
Footsteps that lead to

26
00:01:21,864 --> 00:01:25,200
With a taste so overpowering, never to disappear, disappear

27
00:01:25,659 --> 00:01:27,452
The other side of the world

28
00:01:38,962 --> 00:01:41,214
To live a good and honest life

29
00:01:41,213 --> 00:01:43,799
To live without causing any sorrow

30
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:46,718
To stay on the straight and narrow, no missteps

31
00:01:46,718 --> 00:01:49,596
Is that how you live without making mistakes?

32
00:01:49,596 --> 00:01:52,515
Is justice about living as you are or

33
00:01:52,516 --> 00:01:55,143
Is justice about faking through life

34
00:01:55,143 --> 00:01:58,021
Need to know what I should be

35
00:01:58,021 --> 00:02:00,690
Who is my true self?

36
00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:02,857
Tell me

37
00:02:06,236 --> 00:02:08,447
Tell me

38
00:02:12,282 --> 00:02:13,033
Once again today

39
00:02:13,033 --> 00:02:15,577
In a world with no answers

40
00:02:15,578 --> 00:02:17,246
I hope

41
00:02:17,246 --> 00:02:18,914
Though I may be awkward

42
00:02:18,913 --> 00:02:21,957
Just together with you, forever

43
00:02:21,957 --> 00:02:23,917
If want to keep laughing so

44
00:02:24,461 --> 00:02:26,087
My heart skips a beat and

45
00:02:26,086 --> 00:02:28,922
Rocks my body yelling

46
00:02:28,923 --> 00:02:31,592
It’s time to move right now

47
00:02:32,592 --> 00:02:35,177
The weakling that I am, over and over

48
00:02:35,177 --> 00:02:36,512
I try to overcome

49
00:02:36,513 --> 00:02:40,600
In this world full of wrong

50
00:02:40,599 --> 00:02:43,727
I want you to smile

51
00:02:43,728 --> 00:02:46,021
So no one will have to cry anymore

52
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:48,731
Want to be strong, strong

53
00:02:48,731 --> 00:02:55,403
So I can stay true to myself

54
00:03:02,786 --> 00:03:06,122
Just so I can protect you

55
00:03:06,122 --> 00:03:08,458
I run, run, run

56
00:03:08,457 --> 00:03:11,876
I’ll overcome “me” that lives inside of me
